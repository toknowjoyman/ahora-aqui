# ahora-aqui
an HCI that asks individuals to document their actions through life to derive value over time. 
"Who controls the past now controls the future. Who controls the present now controls the past"

## Raison d'etre
We spend our days on random actions that add value to our lives, making us smarter, fuelling our confidence. And when asked to elaborate on our credibilty, we stumble, our memories fail us - we no longer see what we've done with our time - and we sell ourselves short. 
We spend 8 hours a day, reporting our actions up the chain. The System anonymizes the data, we lose a record of our life. 

Ahora-Aqui enables us to document all our value-able actions in our own personal timesheet, integrates with our employers time-sheet system (own the data of a third of our lives), and controlling our destiny through visualization tools.
